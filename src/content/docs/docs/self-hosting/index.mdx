<Aside type="caution">
  HyprMCP is still in active development.
  <br />
  We might make <strong>BREAKING CHANGES</strong> and require difficult
  migrations.

If you are only interested in our MCP
[mcp-install-instructions-generator](https://github.com/hyprmcp/mcp-install-instructions-generator)
or our [mcp-gateway](https://github.com/hyprmcp/mcp-gateway), follow the instructions in the component sections.

Make sure you have familiarized yourself with the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/) section.

## Technical Description

Deploying and operating HyprMCP requires a Kubernetes cluster, as Jetski (the orchestrator) will deploy a new [MCP Gateway](https://github.com/hyprmcp/mcp-gateway) instance for every organization.
Jetski creates a Kubernetes custom resource for every organization,
whose lifecycle is managed by the [Metacontroller](https://github.com/metacontroller/metacontroller).

Additionally, an authentication server is required that authenticates users against Jetski and against MCP servers.
Although these servers can theoretically be different instances, we are currently using a single [Dex](https://dexidp.io/) instance for all authentication and authorizations.

## Setup

The setup can be split into two parts:

1. Setting up the Jetski Analytics platform
2. Setting up Jetski MCP Gateway Orchestration

### 1. Jetski Analytics Platform

HyprMCP uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to configure your development environment and execute development tasks.

You can get started locally by running the following commands:

| Step                                                                                                                                                     | Command                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Install dependencies** - Trust mise configuration and install necessary tools                                                                          | <Code code="mise trust && mise install" lang="sh" /> |
| **Start database and mock SMTP server**                                                                                                                  | <Code code="docker compose up -d" lang="sh" />       |
| **Set correct host file entry** - Add the following entry to your `/etc/hosts` file: `127.0.0.1 host.minikube.internal`, or reconfigure the Dex hostname | (manual file edit)                                   |
| **Start the Backend**                                                                                                                                    | <Code code="mise run serve" lang="sh" />             |
| **Start the Frontend**                                                                                                                                   | <Code code="pnpm run start" lang="sh" />             |
| **Generate demo data**                                                                                                                                   | <Code code="mise run generate" lang="sh" />          |

Afterward you can access the frontend at `http://localhost:4200` and log in with: `admin@example.com` / `password`.

### 2. Setting up Jetski MCP Gateway Orchestration

For setting up the orchestration part of Jetski, a Kubernetes cluster is recommended.
We recommend [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) for local testing.
Make sure you have followed all previous steps - especially the `/etc/hosts` entry is required for Dex to work correctly.

| Step                                                                                                                                    | Command                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Start a preconfigured Minikube cluster**                                                                                              | <Code code="mise run minikube-start" lang="sh" />                |
| **Start the platform and deploy metacontroller** - ⚠️ This will perform operations against the currently configured Kubernetes context! | <Code code="mise run serve -- --install-controller" lang="sh" /> |

Now when configuring a new project, it should get successfully deployed to your Kubernetes cluster.
