Jetski only supports MCP servers that use the [streamable HTTP standard](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports#streamable-http).
This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with browser-based MCP clients and support for the latest OAuth2 authorization standard.

<Aside type="tip">
  Most MCP server frameworks already support streamable HTTP. The migration is
  usually straightforward and only requires a different initialization method.

## Install the Jetski CLI

<Aside type="caution">
  Jetski is currently in early access. Join our [waitlist](/waitlist) to get
  priority access and CLI installation instructions.
</Aside>

You can either install the Jetski CLI via Homebrew or download the binary directly from the [releases page](https://github.com/jetski-sh)

```shell
brew install jetski-sh/tap/jetski
```

Alternatively, you can run the CLI directly using `npx` or `uvx` to directly run the latest version of the binary.

## Deploy your first remote MCP server

You can also just run the single command `jetski deploy` to deploy your MCP server to Jetski Cloud,
which will automatically guide you through the setup process.
If you want to set up your project step-by-step, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1.  <Code code="jetski login" lang="shell"></Code>
    Authenticate and connect your project with Jetski Cloud
    Make sure to have already joined our [waitlist](/waitlist) to get early access.
    Then run the following command to connect with the Jetski Cloud:

2.  <Code code="jetski connect" lang="shell"></Code>
    Create your MCP server project on Jetski Cloud Connecting your MCP server to
    Jetski will create a `jetski.json` file in your project directory containing
    the project ID and other configuration details.

3.  <Code code="jetski deploy" lang="shell"></Code>
    This step will deploy your MCP server to Jetski Cloud.
    After this step succeeded you will be able to work with your MCP server under
    <Code code="https://<org>.jetski.cloud/<project>/mcp"></Code>
</Steps>

## Test your remote MCP server

Using the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) you can test your remote MCP server.

<Code code="npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector" lang="shell"></Code>
