Hypr MCP is an open-source, serverless hosting, authentication and analytics provider to deploy MCP servers with a single command.
Engineers use Hypr MCP to let their users easily use their MCP servers by browser-based MCP clients, like Claude, ChatGPT and improve the authorization experience by using the latest OAuth2 login standard for MCP servers out of the box.

Hypr MCP provides insights into the usage of your MCP server, like the number of clients, tool calls, and serverless hosting with a generous free tier - think of it as a Vercel for MCP servers.
