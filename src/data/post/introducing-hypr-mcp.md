We're excited to announce Hypr MCP, an open-source serverless hosting platform designed specifically for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
With Hypr MCP, engineers can deploy their MCP servers with a single command and provide their users with a seamless authentication experience.

## What is Hypr MCP?

Hypr MCP is a comprehensive platform that solves the key challenges of deploying and managing MCP servers:

- **Serverless Hosting**: Deploy your MCP servers without managing infrastructure
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Built-in authentication using the latest OAuth2 standards
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track usage, monitor tool calls, and understand your users
- **Browser-Based Access**: Enable users to access your MCP servers through Claude, ChatGPT, and other browser-based clients

## Why We Built Hypr MCP

The Model Context Protocol has opened up exciting possibilities for AI agents to interact with external tools and data sources.
However, deploying MCP servers and managing authentication has been a significant barrier for many developers.

We built Hypr MCP to make it as easy to deploy an MCP server as it is to deploy a web application on Vercel.
Our goal is to remove the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on building great MCP tools.

## Key Features

### Single Command Deployment

Deploy your MCP server with just one command:

```bash
hypr deploy
```

That's it!
Your server is live, authenticated, and ready to use.

### OAuth2 Authentication Out of the Box

Security is critical when exposing tools to AI agents.
Hypr MCP provides OAuth2 authentication by default, ensuring that only authorized users can access your MCP server.

Users can authenticate with their existing accounts from popular providers, making the onboarding experience smooth and familiar.

### Comprehensive Analytics

Understanding how your MCP server is being used is crucial for improvement and optimization.
Our analytics dashboard provides insights into:

- Number of active clients
- Tool call frequency and patterns
- Usage trends over time
- Error rates and debugging information

### Generous Free Tier

We believe in making MCP servers accessible to everyone.
That's why we offer a generous free tier that includes:

- Up to 1,000 tool calls per month
- 3 MCP server deployments
- Full analytics access
- OAuth2 authentication

## Getting Started

Getting started with Hypr MCP is simple:

1. Install the Hypr CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @hyprmcp/cli
   ```

2. Initialize your MCP server:
   ```bash
   hypr init my-mcp-server
   ```

3. Deploy:
   ```bash
   hypr deploy
   ```

Your MCP server is now live and ready to be used by Claude, ChatGPT, and other MCP-compatible clients!

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning.
We have an exciting roadmap ahead:

- **Custom domains** for your MCP servers
- **Team collaboration** features
- **Advanced monitoring** and alerting
- **SDK improvements** for easier development
- **More authentication providers**
