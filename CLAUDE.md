## What is Jetski?

Jetski is an open-source, serverless hosting, authentication and analytics provider to deploy
MCP servers with a single command.

Engineers use Jetski to let their users easily use their MCP servers by browser-based MCP clients,
like Claude, ChatGPT and improve the authorization experience by using the latest OAuth2 login
standard for MCP servers out of the box.

Additionally, Jetski provides insights into the usage of your MCP server, like the number of clients,
tool calls.

MCP servers can be deployed with a single command, and the hosting is serverless with a generous free tier,
think of it as a Vercel for MCP servers.

## Development Commands

This is an Astro-based documentation website using Starlight. All commands use pnpm:

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server at localhost:4321
- `pnpm build` - Build production site to ./dist/
- `pnpm preview` - Preview build locally
- `pnpm lint` - Check formatting with Prettier
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm astro ...` - Run Astro CLI commands

## Project Architecture

This is a Jetski documentation website built with:

- **Astro 5.11.1** with Starlight documentation theme
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling with custom @astrojs/starlight-tailwind integration
- **TypeScript** with strict configuration
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Links validator** plugin for internal link checking

### Key Structure

- `src/content/docs/` - Main documentation content
  - `index.mdx` - Homepage with splash template
  - `pricing.mdx` - Pricing page
  - `docs/guides/` - Guide documentation
  - `docs/reference/` - Reference documentation (autogenerated sidebar)
- `src/styles/global.css` - Global CSS with Tailwind layers and custom spacing
- `astro.config.mjs` - Main configuration with Starlight setup
- `src/content.config.ts` - Content collections configuration

### Configuration Details

- Site URL: https://jetski.sh
- Edit links point to GitHub repository
- Sidebar configured with manual guides section and autogenerated reference
- Table of contents shows headings levels 2-6
- Prerendering enabled for static generation
- Custom CSS layers: base, starlight, theme, components, utilities

### Component Overrides

To override Starlight theme components:
1. Find the original component in `node_modules/@astrojs/starlight/components/`
2. Copy the component to `src/components/`
3. Add the component reference to the `components` object in `astro.config.mjs`
4. Example: `PageTitle: './src/components/PageTitle.astro'`

Available Starlight components can be found in:
- `node_modules/@astrojs/starlight/components/` - All base components
- Key components: `Page.astro`, `PageTitle.astro`, `ContentPanel.astro`, `Header.astro`, `Footer.astro`, `Hero.astro`, `Sidebar.astro`, etc.

### CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow builds and lints on push/PR to main branch using:

- Node.js 24.1
- pnpm 10
- Runs `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run build`
